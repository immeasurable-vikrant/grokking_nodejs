## üìå Overview  
DevTinder is a **MERN stack** web application designed to help developers **connect and collaborate**, similar to Tinder but for the tech community.  

This repository contains the **frontend** of DevTinder, built using **React + Vite** for fast development, optimized performance, and modular UI components. The project is styled with **Tailwind CSS & Daisy UI**, and **React Router DOM** is used for seamless navigation between pages.  

Currently, the frontend is in the **development phase**, with foundational setup and UI components being implemented.

## ‚úÖ Steps Completed  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring Vite + React**  
- Initialized the **React project using Vite**, which provides faster builds and optimized performance compared to Create React App.  
- Verified that the project setup is correct for smooth development.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Code Cleanup & Initial Testing**  
- Removed unnecessary boilerplate code generated by Vite.  
- Conducted a **test run** to confirm that the development server is working correctly.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Installing & Configuring Tailwind CSS (v3)**  
- Installed **Tailwind CSS v3**, a utility-first CSS framework for fast styling.  
- Configured Tailwind by modifying the **`tailwind.config.js`** and linked it with the project's styles.  
- Successfully tested Tailwind classes to ensure proper integration.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Installing & Configuring Daisy UI**  
- Installed **Daisy UI**, a Tailwind-based component library, for pre-designed UI components.  
- Configured Daisy UI within Tailwind settings to make components available globally.  
- Tested Daisy UI components to verify proper rendering and styling.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Creating `Navbar.jsx`**  
- Designed a **responsive navigation bar** using Daisy UI components.  
- Ensured the Navbar includes essential elements like **logo, navigation links, and a mobile-friendly menu**.  
- Used React state where necessary for **handling dropdowns or responsive behavior**.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Installing & Testing React Router DOM**  
- Installed **React Router DOM** to manage client-side navigation.  
- Created a **basic routing structure**, including routes for Home, Profile, and Feed.  
- Tested navigation between pages to ensure seamless user experience.  

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Browser Router & Nested Routes**  
- Implemented **BrowserRouter** for handling client-side routing.  
- Structured **Routes & Nested Routes** inside a `Body.jsx` component.  
- Ensured proper parent-child route handling for pages within the application.  

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing `Outlet` in `Body.jsx`**  
- Used **`Outlet` from React Router** to dynamically render child components inside the `Body` component.  
- This ensures that different pages load properly within the layout while keeping the Navbar and Footer consistent.  

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Creating the Footer Component**  
- Added a **Footer component** to balance the layout at the bottom of the page.  
- Styled the footer using Tailwind and Daisy UI for a **consistent design**.

## üéØ Next Steps  

- **Authentication Pages**: Develop **Login & Signup** pages for user authentication.  
- **Homepage & Feed UI**: Start building the main **Feed Page**, where users can explore developer profiles.  
- **Improving UI & Responsiveness**: Enhance **layout, spacing, and responsiveness** for mobile and desktop views.  
- **API Integration**: Connect the frontend with the **DevTinder Backend** for authentication and user interactions.

## üî• Conclusion  
The **DevTinder Frontend** setup is progressing well, with the foundational UI components and routing in place. The next phase will focus on **user authentication, profile management, and interactive UI elements**.  

With **Vite for speed, Tailwind for styling, Daisy UI for components, and React Router for navigation**, the frontend is well-structured for scalability and performance. üöÄ
