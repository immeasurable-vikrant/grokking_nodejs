## üìå Overview  
DevTinder is a **MERN stack** web application designed to help developers **connect and collaborate**, similar to Tinder but for the tech community.  

This update focuses on **building the authentication page, integrating API calls, and implementing state management using Redux Toolkit**. The login system ensures secure authentication using **JWT tokens stored in cookies**, with proper CORS configuration to handle credentials.

## ‚úÖ Steps Completed  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Created Login Page**  
- Designed a **responsive login page** with an input form for email and password.  
- Used controlled components in React to handle form inputs.  
- Added form validation to prevent empty fields or incorrect email formats.  
- Styled the page using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean UI.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Installed & Configured Axios**  
- Installed **Axios**, a promise-based HTTP client, to manage API requests efficiently.  
- Set up **global Axios defaults** to include the backend‚Äôs base URL for easy request handling.  
- Used **async-await** inside API functions to ensure proper request handling.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Installed & Configured CORS in Backend**  
- Installed **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** middleware to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend.  
- Configured CORS settings in the backend by specifying:  
  - **origin**: Allows requests only from the frontend domain.  
  - **credentials: true**: Enables sending cookies with API requests.  
- Without proper CORS configuration, the browser blocks API requests due to security policies.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Making API Calls with Credentials**  
- Modified all Axios requests to include `{ withCredentials: true }`.  
- This ensures the backend sends **cookies containing the JWT token** to the frontend.  
- If `credentials: true` is not passed, the backend will **not store or retrieve session tokens**, breaking authentication.  
- Implemented proper error handling to display user-friendly messages if login fails.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Installed Redux Toolkit & React Redux**  
- Installed **Redux Toolkit**, which simplifies global state management compared to traditional Redux.  
- Installed **React Redux**, allowing components to connect with the Redux store.  
- Redux helps manage authentication state across different components, ensuring data consistency.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Configured Redux Store**  
- Wrapped the application with `<Provider>` to enable global state management.  
- Created **Redux slices** to manage authentication, including:  
  - **User data storage** after login.  
  - **Token storage for future API requests**.  
- Added the authentication slice to the **Redux store** and ensured state updates upon login.  

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Installed Redux DevTools for Chrome**  
- Installed **Redux DevTools**, a browser extension to monitor state changes.  
- Verified that login updates **Redux state correctly**, ensuring user authentication status is reflected across components.  

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Verified Login Flow & Redux Integration**  
- Logged in with test credentials and **confirmed that user data is stored in Redux state**.  
- Checked **Redux DevTools** to monitor state updates after login.  
- Ensured that token persistence works properly for future API calls.  

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Updated Navbar After Login**  
- Modified the **Navbar component** to reflect authentication status dynamically.  
- Once logged in, the navbar:  
  - **Displays the user‚Äôs profile picture** retrieved from Redux state.  
  - **Shows a welcome message** with the logged-in user‚Äôs name.  
- Ensured that these updates happen instantly after login without requiring a page refresh.  

### **üîü Code Refactoring & Organization**  
- Created a **constants file** for storing the backend‚Äôs base URL.  
- Moved **reusable UI components** (Navbar, Footer, etc.) to a dedicated **components folder**.  
- Ensured that all API calls are **modular and reusable**, improving code maintainability.  

---

## üéØ Next Steps  

- **Build Signup Page**: Develop user registration with proper validation and API integration.  
- **Session Persistence**: Implement logic to keep users logged in even after a page refresh.  
- **Logout Functionality**: Add a **logout button** that clears the session and updates UI dynamically.  
- **Feed Page Development**: Start building the **developer feed UI**, where users can explore profiles.  

---

## üî• Conclusion  
The **authentication system** is now integrated with the backend, and state management is fully set up using **Redux Toolkit**. The next focus will be on improving **user session management, signup functionality, and logout handling**.  

With **Axios for API calls, Redux for state management, and CORS for secure token handling**, DevTinder‚Äôs authentication is now **structured, secure, and scalable**. üöÄ
