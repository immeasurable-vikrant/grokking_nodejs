# Grokking Node.js - Deep Dive into Node.js

## Overview

This repository contains detailed notes and explanations on Node.js, inspired by Akshay Saini's Node.js series. While the core content is derived from the notes of GitHub user [akshadjaiswal](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal), I have expanded on it by diving deeper into advanced topics, providing more in-depth explanations, and comparing Node.js with other languages. My goal is to answer the critical "What," "Why," and "How" of various aspects of Node.js, while also providing a broader understanding of its inner workings, including topics like the V8 engine, compilers, the thread pool, and much more.

In short, this is Akshay Saini's Node.js series "on steroids," with more insights and deeper explorations into the inner mechanics of Node.js.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Node.js Topics**: This repository covers a broad range of Node.js topics starting from the basics all the way to more advanced concepts.
  
- **Advanced Insights**: Topics like V8 internals, thread pool management, compilers, and other advanced topics are explored in greater detail.
  
- **Comparisons with Other Languages**: I also compare how Node.js handles certain tasks in relation to other programming languages, providing a wider perspective.

- **What, Why, and How**: A focus on answering not just the "What" but also the "Why" and "How" behind the topics discussed.

## Inspiration & Credits

The content in this repository is inspired by the work of Akshay Saini's Node.js series. The original notes are from GitHub user [akshadjaiswal](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal), who has done an excellent job in explaining Node.js concepts.
