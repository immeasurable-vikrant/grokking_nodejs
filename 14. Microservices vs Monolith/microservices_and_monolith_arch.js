 Microservices vs Monolith - How to build a project
    Software Project Development in the Industry
        - Waterfall Model Overview
            The Waterfall Model is a sequential software development process that consists of a series of steps. Each step must be completed before moving on to the next. This model is one of the traditional approaches used in the software industry for project development.

            - Steps in the Waterfall Model
                - Requirement
                    - Gather and analyze all project requirements.
                    - Document the functional and non-functional requirements.
                    - Stakeholders provide input to ensure a clear understanding of the project's needs.
                    - Roles Involved: Business Analysts, Project Managers, Stakeholders, Product Owners
                
                - Design
                    - Create a system and software design based on the requirements.
                    - Architectural design: High-level system structure.
                    - Detailed design: Specifies how each component will work.
                    - Roles Involved: Solution Architects, UX/UI Designers, System Designers, Technical Leads
                
                - Development
                    - Actual coding of the software begins based on the design documents.
                    - Development teams implement functionalities and integrate different modules.
                    - Roles Involved: Software Developers, Backend/Frontend Developers, Database Administrators, DevOps Engineers
                    
                - Testing
                    - Perform testing to identify defects and bugs.
                    - Different testing methods include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
                    - Roles Involved: Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers, Testers, Test Leads, Automation Engineers
                
                - Deployment
                    - Once testing is successful, the software is deployed to a live environment.
                    - The deployment phase includes user training and system configuration.
                    - Roles Involved: DevOps Engineers, System Administrators, Release Managers, IT Support
                
                - Maintenance
                    - Ongoing support for the software post-deployment.
                    - Fixing any issues that arise and implementing necessary updates or enhancements.
                    - Roles Involved: Support Engineers, Maintenance Team, Developers, IT Support, Customer Support

        Project Building Strategies
            - Overview
                There are two main architectural approaches to building software projects: Monolith and Microservices. Each has its own characteristics, advantages, and challenges. Understanding the parameters that differentiate these architectures is essential for selecting the right approach for a given project.

                1. Monolith Architecture
                    - A single unified codebase where all components are interconnected.
                    - Easier to deploy since the entire application is packaged and released as a single unit.
                    - Suitable for smaller projects or applications with tightly coupled components.
                2. Microservices Architecture
                    - A distributed system where different functionalities are separated into individual services.
                    - Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
                    - Ideal for large, complex projects where different teams handle different services.
