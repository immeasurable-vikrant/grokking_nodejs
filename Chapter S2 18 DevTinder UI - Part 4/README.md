## 📌 Overview  
DevTinder is a **MERN stack** web application designed to help developers **connect and collaborate**. The latest update focuses on the **Connections Page** and **Request Review Functionality**, allowing users to view, accept, and reject connection requests.  

This update includes:  
- Fetching and displaying **accepted connections**.  
- Fetching and managing **pending connection requests**.  
- Implementing **Redux state management** for connections.  
- Handling **accept/reject actions dynamically**.  

---

## ✅ Steps Completed  

### **1️⃣ Implemented Feature to See All Connections**  
- Designed a **Connections Page** to display all accepted connections.  
- Created a structured layout for showing **profile pictures, names, and interaction buttons**.  

### **2️⃣ API to Get Connections**  
- Integrated an **API call to fetch all accepted connections** from the backend.  
- Ensured only authenticated users can access this data.  

### **3️⃣ Created Redux Store for Connections (`connectionSlice`)**  
- Defined a **Redux slice (`connectionSlice`)** to store and manage the user’s connections.  
- Updated Redux state when new connections are fetched.  
- Ensured state updates dynamically across components.  

### **4️⃣ Displaying Connections List in UI**  
- Retrieved connection data from **Redux store** and displayed it in a structured format.  
- Used **Tailwind CSS & Daisy UI** to style the connection cards.  

### **5️⃣ Implemented Feature to Show All Connection Requests**  
- Added a **Request Page** where users can view pending connection requests.  
- Displayed sender details (name, profile picture) along with action buttons.  

### **6️⃣ Fetching & Storing Connection Requests**  
- Called **API to fetch pending connection requests**.  
- Stored request data in **Redux store** for efficient state management.  
- Ensured UI updates dynamically as requests are received or processed.  

### **7️⃣ Accept & Reject Connection Requests**  
- Implemented functionality to **accept or reject** incoming connection requests.  
- Upon user action:  
  - **Accepted requests** move to the **Connections Page**.  
  - **Rejected requests** are removed from the UI.  
- Updated **Redux store** after each action to ensure UI reflects changes immediately.

## 🎯 Next Steps  

- **Enhance Connection Request UI**: Improve animations and interaction buttons.    
- **Optimize API Calls**: Implement caching strategies to reduce unnecessary API requests.

## 🔥 Conclusion  
The **Connections Page and Request Review functionality** are now fully implemented in DevTinder. Users can now view, accept, and manage their connections efficiently.  

With **Redux for state management, API integration for request handling, and UI improvements**, DevTinder is evolving into a more **interactive and user-friendly** platform. 🚀
