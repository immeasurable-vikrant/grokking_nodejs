## 📌 Overview  
The goal is to **deploy the DevTinder backend on an AWS EC2 instance** and configure **Nginx as a reverse proxy**. This ensures that API requests from the frontend reach the backend seamlessly.  

This deployment involves:  
- Setting up the **Node.js backend on AWS**.  
- Running the backend **continuously using PM2**.  
- **Configuring MongoDB Atlas** to allow external connections.  
- Using **Nginx as a reverse proxy** to forward `/api` requests to the backend.  

---

## ✅ Steps Completed  

### **1️⃣ Installing Backend Dependencies on EC2 Instance**  
- Logged into the EC2 instance via SSH.  
- Navigated to the **DevTinder Backend** directory.  
- Installed all required **Node.js dependencies** for the backend.  

### **2️⃣ Configuring the Backend Start Script**  
- Added a **start script** to run `node app.js` for backend deployment.  
- Ensured the script runs properly on the instance.  

### **3️⃣ Enabling MongoDB Atlas Access for EC2 Instance**  
- Opened **MongoDB Atlas** and navigated to **Network Access Settings**.  
- Added the **EC2 instance IP address** to the whitelist.  
- Verified that the database connection was successful.  

### **4️⃣ Allowing Backend Port 3000 on AWS Security Groups**  
- Logged into **AWS Console** and opened **Security Groups** for the EC2 instance.  
- Added an **inbound rule** to allow traffic on **port 3000**.  
- Ensured external requests can reach the backend.  

### **5️⃣ Installing & Configuring PM2**  
- Installed **PM2**, a process manager for running Node.js applications continuously.  
- Used PM2 to **start the backend server** and keep it running.  
- Verified logs using PM2 commands for monitoring and debugging.  

### **6️⃣ Running the Backend Using PM2**  
- Started the backend server with PM2.  
- Used various PM2 commands to:  
  - Check running processes.  
  - View logs for debugging.  
  - Restart or delete PM2 processes when needed.  

### **7️⃣ Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy for Backend**  
- Opened the **Nginx configuration file** to edit the default settings.  
- Added a **proxy_pass configuration** to route `/api` requests to the Node.js backend on port 3000.  
- Ensured that Nginx correctly forwards requests from the frontend to the backend.  

### **8️⃣ Restarting Nginx to Apply Changes**  
- Restarted the **Nginx service** to apply the new configuration.  
- Verified that API requests were now being properly forwarded.  

### **9️⃣ Updating API Calls in Frontend**  
- Changed the `BASE_URL` in the frontend from `http://localhost:3000` to `/api`.  
- Ensured that API calls from the frontend now correctly route to the backend through Nginx.  

### **🔟 Successfully Deployed & Live on AWS**  
- Tested the deployment by making requests to the live backend.  
- Verified that both **frontend and backend** work seamlessly together.  
- **DevTinder Backend is now fully live on AWS!** 🎉  

---

## 🎯 Next Steps  

- Enable **HTTPS with SSL** for secure API communication.  
- Optimize **PM2 process management** for better performance.  
- Implement **logging and monitoring tools** for backend stability.  
- Set up **automatic deployments** for future updates.  

---

## 🔥 Conclusion  
The **DevTinder Backend** is now successfully **deployed on AWS EC2**, with **Nginx handling API requests** and **PM2 keeping the backend live 24/7**. With further optimizations like **SSL and automated deployments**, the backend is ready to scale efficiently. 🚀
