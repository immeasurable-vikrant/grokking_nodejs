Getting Started with Node.js: From Installation to Writing Your First JavaScript Code

Downloading and Installing Node.js
    Step 1: Download Node.js
        Visit the official Node.js website.
        You will see two versions available for download:
        LTS (Long-Term Support): Recommended for most users as it is more stable.
        Current: Includes the latest features but may be less stable.
        Click on the LTS version to download the installer.

    Step 2: Install Node.js
        Run the installer that you downloaded.
        Follow the installation wizard:
        Accept the license agreement.
        Choose the installation path (default is usually fine).
        Ensure that the option "Add to PATH" is checked (this allows you to use Node.js from the command line).
        Complete the installation by clicking Finish.
    Step 3: Verify Installation
        Open Command Prompt (CMD) or Terminal.
        Type the following command to check the installed Node.js version:
        node -v

Writing Your First JavaScript Code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code
        Visit the Visual Studio Code website.
        Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
        Run the installer and follow the prompts to install VS Code.

    Step 2: Open VS Code and Create a New File
        Launch Visual Studio Code.
        Open a new file by clicking on File > New File or use the shortcut Ctrl + N.
        Save the file with a .js extension, for example, app.js, by clicking on File > Save As.
        
    Step 3: Write Your First JavaScript Code
        In the newly created .js file, type the following code:
        console.log("Hello, World!");
        Save the file.

    Step 4: Run the Code in VS Code Terminal
        Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by clicking on View > Terminal or using the shortcut `Ctrl +``.

    Ensure that you are in the correct directory where your .js file is saved.
    Run the code by typing the following command in the terminal:
    node app.js
    You should see the output Hello, World! printed in the terminal.

    Writing and Running JavaScript Code in Command Prompt (CMD)
        Step 1: Open Command Prompt
            Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.
    
        Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory
            Use the cd command to change the directory to where you want to save your JavaScript file:
            cd path\to\your\directory
        
        Step 3: Create a JavaScript File
            Create a new JavaScript file using any text editor (like Notepad) or directly from CMD:
            echo console.log("Hello, World!") > app.js
    
        Step 4: Run the JavaScript Code
            Execute the JavaScript file using Node.js by typing:
            node app.js
